This mechanism was designed within a 150 cm Ã— 50 cm 2D workspace to lift the maximum possible load to the highest possible height using a rigid bar, three pin supports, and a linear actuator. I began by sketching the design space to scale and positioning the components strategically: Pin A serves as the ground pivot, Pin B anchors the actuator on the base, and Pin C connects to the top end of the rigid bar where the load is applied. The bar, approximately 130 cm long, rotates upward about Pin A as the actuator extends, converting linear motion into rotational lifting motion. The actuator is attached between Pin B and an intermediate point on the bar to maximize mechanical advantage and maintain structural stability. The reactions at Pins A and B balance the forces generated by the actuator and the external load, ensuring a stable triangular configuration throughout motion. This setup allows efficient lifting within the confined dimensions while minimizing bending stresses in the bar.
