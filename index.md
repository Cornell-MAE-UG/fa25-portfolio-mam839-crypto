## About Me


!["Profile Picture"](assets/mam839_headshot.jpg)

My name is Marcos Martinez, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University passionate about designing, building, and testing mechanical systems for aerospace and robotics applications. My experience spans from developing high-performance quadcopters, where I applied aerodynamics and structural mechanics principles to optimize flight stability and durability, to leading the design of a scout drone that supports autonomous Mars rover missions. Within Cornellâ€™s Space Domain Awareness Laboratory, I am implementing a cold-gas propulsion system for spacecraft attitude control, working directly on thruster placement, nozzle performance, and system integration. I thrive in hands-on environments that combine CAD modeling, rapid prototyping, and  machining, and I am motivated by the challenge of turning mechanical concepts into reliable hardware for real-world mission applications.
