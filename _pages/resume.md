#### Projects
- **First Person View (FPV) Drone**:  
  *Designed, modeled, and iteratively prototyped an FPV drone optimized for aerodynamic efficiency and filming high-speed flight tests.* 
 
  - 3D-printed the initial frame to identify and correct design flaws before machining the final version in carbon fiber.
  - Designed and integrated a custom mount to stabilize and support an HD FPV camera.
  - Fully assembled, tuned, and flight-tested the drone, achieving a durable high-speed platform with an optimal 20-minute flight time. 
  
- **Mars Rover Scouting Drone**:  
  *Designing and CAD-modeling a custom quadcopter in collaboration with Cornell’s Mars Rover project team, including the frame structure, battery and motor mounts, and a landing mechanism. Developing the drone as an autonomous scout platform capable of receiving user-defined coordinates and following designated flight paths to support the rover during competition missions.*  

  - Will be built to withstand harsh weather conditions and variable terrain to simulate a misison on Mars.
  - Targeting an operational battery life of ~20 minutes while remaining within competition parameters to support autonomous scouting missions.
